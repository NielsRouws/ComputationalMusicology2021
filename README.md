## Comparing the Rock genre over fours decades 60s-10s

Spotify has 6 playlist called the XXs Rock Anthems for the decades 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, 00s, and 10s. I'm interested
in how rock has evolved from the 60s to the 10s. Multiple bands have made music spanning more than one decade
and I would like to investigate how their earlier work compares to their later works and whether bands have
influenced each other. Moreover when large subgenres of rock started to appear and which bands were responsible. 
There are three main groups to compare: the early bands from the 60s and 70s, the middle 
80 and 90s bands, and late 00s and 10s. 

The use of more digital elements in music will probably increase over the years, and more subgenres are likely to have
emerged over the years. I am unsure in what way the bands have influenced each other if any at all.

The tracks are all popular songs from their respective time periods but not all songs are original. 
Especially among the older songs are a lot of remastered versions. Another downside is the small 
amount of songs representing a complete decade of song releases. 

Atypical bands might be bands like Queen which is known for releasing songs in a multitude of genres 
and bands that have released albums spanning multiple decades. Typical bands might be bands like U2 that appear 
in one playlist with multiple songs.
